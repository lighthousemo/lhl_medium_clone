Now, imagine if these animals were mapped onto our actual surroundings — playing on the beach, you could find a sea dragon; exploring the arctic tundra, you’d find a snow wolf.

Having spent the past few days capturing over 100 Pidgeys, a dozen Eevees, and an extra-large Arcanine, I wanted to share initial reactions, upcoming obstacles, and how I think the game could evolve from here.",
